Calculator 
This code creates a simple calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user in-
teracts with the calculator by clicking buttons, and the JavaScript code updates the input field ac-
cordingly. The code uses the eval() function to evaluate the mathematical expression when the "="
button is clicked. The "AC" button clears the input field, and the "DEL" button deletes the last char-
acter. The CSS styles the calculator's layout, colors, and design, with a dark theme and rounded but-
tons.
